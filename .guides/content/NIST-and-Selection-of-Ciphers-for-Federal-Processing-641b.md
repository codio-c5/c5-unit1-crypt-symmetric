## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Publishes guidelines for federal agencies to ensure that sensitive federal information is protected.

- In 1973 the agency, then called the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), solicited algorithms to be used for protecting sensitive federal data.
- In 1976 DES (Data Encryption Standard) was approved as a federal standard.
- In 1997 NIST called for new algorithms to replace DES, as the key length (56 bits) used in DES was small for the increasing computational power.
- In 2000 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) was approved.
