Figure 5.1 shows the overall structure of the AES encryption process. The cipher takes a plaintext block size of 128 bits, or 16 bytes. The key length can be 16, 24, or 32 bytes (128, 192, or 256 bits). The algorithm is referred to as AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256, depending on the key length. 

Note that in both DES and AES there is a key schedule where keys are generated for different rounds of the cipher. This is typical of symmetric ciphers.
