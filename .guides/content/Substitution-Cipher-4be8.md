In this cipher, each letter/character in the plaintext alphabet is substituted by a different letter/character in the ciphertext alphabet. 

If the alphabet we are using for the plaintext and ciphertext are both letters in the English alphabet, then the substitution cipher substitutes each letter for a different letter. In this case, the key is a reordering of the letters in the alphabet.

For example, the key

```
ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
```

would mean `A` is mapped to `Z`, `B` is mapped to `Y`, etc.
