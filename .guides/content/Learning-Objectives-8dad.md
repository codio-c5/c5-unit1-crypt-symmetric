Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to

- Define encryption, decryption, plaintext, ciphertext, and encryption/decryption key, and explain their use in cryptography. 
- Describe attack scenarios against an encryption algorithm.
- Use early cipher methods such as a Caesar cipher or substitution cipher to encrypt/decrypt data by hand. 
- Identify commonly used algorithms for symmetric encryption. 
- Explain the challenge of key distribution in symmetric key encryption.
- Illustrate how symmetric key encryption works using software such as Kryptos.
