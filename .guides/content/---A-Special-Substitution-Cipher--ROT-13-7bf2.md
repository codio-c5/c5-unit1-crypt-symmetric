Substitute each letter with another one according to the mapping in the diagram.

- What is special about this cipher? 
- Encrypt a message using ROT13. 
- Then encrypt the resulting ciphertext again with ROT13.
- What do you get?

Note that this exercise can be skipped if time is a concern.

When ROT13 is applied twice to a message, you get the message back because of 13 being the number of the middle character in the alphabet. 

```
Plaintext  ------------------>  Ciphertext  -----------------> Plaintext
           encrypt with ROT13               encrypt with ROT13 
```

Note that both arrows have encrypt. Normaly, the second arrow would have encrypt but ROT13 is special.

As another hands on activity, students can try encrypting a message twice using their key and see if this property holds.
