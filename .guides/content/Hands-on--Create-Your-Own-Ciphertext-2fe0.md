- Write your message 
- Encrypt your message with the key, and write the ciphertext on a separate piece of paper.
- Provide the ciphertext to your neighbor
- What does your neighbor need to decrypt the message?
- Share what he/she needs with your neighbor. 
- Decrypt the ciphertext that you get from your neighbor.

||| guidance
In order to save time, provide students with a copy of the table printed on paper. 
Students should have the key, their message, and the ciphertext, all on separate pieces of paper; they share with their neighbor only the ciphertext at first, then the key.
