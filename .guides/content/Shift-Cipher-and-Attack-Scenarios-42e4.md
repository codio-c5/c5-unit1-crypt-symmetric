**Task**: Think about what it takes to decrypt a ciphertext that is obtained using the shift cipher under these scenarios


- **Ciphertext only attacks**  – How can you proceed to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext, GJFZYNKZQ IFD? 
- **Known plaintext attacks** – You know that HELLO encrypts to MJQQT. Can you find the key?
- **Chosen plaintext attacks** – You have the opportunity to choose a plaintext and get its ciphertext (without knowing the key). What would you choose for the plaintext?
- **Chosen ciphertext attacks** – You have the opportunity to choose a ciphertext and get the plaintext for it (without knowing the key). What would you choose for the ciphertext?

- **Ciphertext only attacks** – How can you proceed to break the cipher if all you have is the ciphertext, GJFZYNKZQ IFD? Answer: Brute force the 26 possible keys and see which gives a meaningful message.
- **Known plaintext attacks** – You know that  HELLO encrypts to MJQQT. Can you find the key? Answer: Simply figure out how much H is shifted to get to M.
**Chosen plaintext attacks** – You have the opportunity to choose a plaintext and get its ciphertext (without knowing the key). What would you choose for the plaintext? Answer: Choose A or any other letter for the plaintext.
**Chosen ciphertext attacks** – You have the opportunity to choose a ciphertext and get the plaintext for it (without knowing the key). What would you choose for the ciphertext? Answer: Choose A or any other letter for the ciphertext.

The correct plaintext for the ciphertext GJFZYNKZQ IFD is BEAUTIFUL DAY.
