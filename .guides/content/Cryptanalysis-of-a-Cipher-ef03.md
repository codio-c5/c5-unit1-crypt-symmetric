Clearly state assumptions on what an attacker may have. Following Kerckhoffsâ€™s Principle, we assume that the details of the algorithm used for encryption is known. Does the attacker have

- Ciphertext?
- Pairs of plaintexts and ciphertexts?
- The ability to choose any plaintext (and obtain the corresponding ciphertext) without knowledge of the key?
- The ability to choose certain ciphertexts and get the corresponding plaintext without knowledge of the key?
