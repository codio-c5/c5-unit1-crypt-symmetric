Modern symmetric key algorithms are great! They are fast and secure when implemented correctly and keys are chosen properly.

## Problem
How to get the keys to the two parties? 
- Need a secure channel â€“ a channel that makes it very difficult for the adversary to access the actual plaintext that is being transmitted.
- But the Internet is not secure!
