## Generalization of the Caesar cipher
Shift each letter in the message `k` letters in the alphabet

### Example with Key=11

|-|-|
| plaintext | `meet me after the toga party` |
| ciphertext | `XPPE XP LQEPC ESP EZRL ALCEJ` |

### What would it take to break the shift cipher?
That is, if you know that a ciphertext is obtained using a shift cipher, how would you get the original plaintext?
